            <h2 class="text-thin">Series</h2>
            <h3 class="text-thin">Fall Lecture Series</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom-10">
              Every single fall semester, SWS hosts a comprehensive multi-week seminar series in which students, mainly freshman and sophomores
              but we've had upperclassmen in attendance as well, learn about a breadth of essential finance topics. These lectures are led by experienced
              upperclassmen who've had work experience at top firms on the Street, highly-rated Economics professors and successful
              industry professionals. While participants learn a breadth of topics, we delve deep in these lectures and keep things engaging. Topics you
              can expect to learn are <span style="color: #bd139b">personal investing, sourcing investment ideas, and understanding the 3 financial statements and 10-K/10-Q reports.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-thin">Research Committee</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom-40">
              Every spring semester, SWS hosts an intensive Research Committee for members who are looking to gain more hands-on experience with finance. This
              program is particularly recommended for those who completed the Fall Lecture Series. Throughout the term, we hold pitching cycles, where
              analysts learn essentials about pitching (format, conventions, analysis) and work in groups to pitch a stock from a certain industry.
              <span style="color: #bd139b">Exciting upcoming additions to Research Committee: </span>SWS is looking to hold a more advanced Research Committee
              year-round for analysts who demonstrate exceptional research and pitching skills. The benefits of this group include priority for competition
              sponsorships, research publishment in an intercollegiate research library used by non-institutional and institutional investors,
              and an opportunity to manage real funds.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-thin">Workshops</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-40">
              In addition to our main initiatives, throughout the year, we run several workshops for further member enrichment. One of our most popular is
              Interview Prep. We hold Interview Prep workshops throughout the year led by upperclassmen who've interned at companies like Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan,
              McKinsey & Company, and more. In these sessions, we give insider tips and career help that's not common in other info sessions or workshops. Some other
              events we've held in the past are internship panels, crash courses with professors, collaborations with other finance clubs, as well as some social
              networking events <span style="color: #bd139b">(the lovely National Executive Director sometimes drops by too!).</span>
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-thin">Other Opportunities</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-0">
              While education is definitely our main focus at SWS, we don't ignore the fact that <span style="color: #bd139b">many of our members are aiming for successful careers in the financial
              services, and we are dedicated to propelling them forward. </span> We believe that the knowledge we provide in our series and workshops is something
              that extensively prepares our members for interviews and bolsters their resumes, and we extend several opportunities for members to showcase that work.
              We co-host info sessions with competitive companies for our members and send out exclusive programs on our mailing list.
              We sponsor members to go to conferences and competitions such as the William & Mary Stock Pitch Competition, the Women in Investing Summit, and the
              Intercollegiate Business Conference. National members also have the chance to go to The SWS National Conference, The National Summit, and The National
              Stock Pitch Competition.
